# RADconstruct
Jupyter notebooks for investigating the output for the Regulatory Activity Decoder (RAD) construct developed in Dowell laboratory at CU Boulder.

*a) RAD Construct illustration of the main component of the dual fluorophore reporter construct. b) Control conditions (basal level). GFP and RFP are expected to be lowly expressed at basal level with the GFP/RFP ratio is near 1. c) Treatment conditions where Enhancer is "on". GFP fluorescent signal should be greater than RFP with GFP/RFP ratio > 1*

More details about the RAD construct can be found in Appendix B of Thesis ["Investigating exogenous stressors impact on transcription in population with Down syndrome"](https://dna.colorado.edu/media/thesis_pdf/WestfallThesis.pdf).
